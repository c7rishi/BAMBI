Statistical analyses of directional or angular data have applications in a variety of fields, such as geology, meteorology and bioinformatics. Motivated by data on protein backbone angles, in the R package `BAMBI` we implement random data generation, density evaluation, and computation of theoretical summary measures (variances and correlation coefficients) for the three  bivariate angular distributions, viz. wrapped normal, von Mises sine and von Mises cosine distribution, and two univariate angular distributions: the univariate wrapped normal and the univariate von Mises distribution, for analyzing bivariate (and univariate) angular data. The major contribution of `BAMBI` to statistical computing is in providing modern MCMC (including Hamiltonian MC) based Bayesian methods for modeling angular data using finite mixtures of these distributions.
