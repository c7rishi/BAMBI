\arguments{
\item{x}{angular MCMC object (with bivariate data).}

\item{fn}{function, or a single character string specifying its name, to evaluate on MCMC samples to estimate
parameters.  Defaults to \code{mean}, which computes the estimated posterior mean.
Note that if \code{fn = "MODE"} (warning: not \code{"mode"}) or \code{fn = "MAP"}, then the maximum aposteriori estimate (MAP) is
calculated.}

\item{type}{Passed to \link{d_fitted}. Possible choices are "point-est" and "post-pred".}

\item{show.data}{logical. Should the data points be added to the contour plot? Ignored if \code{object} is NOT supplied.}

\item{xpoints}{Points on the first (x-) coordinate where the density is to be evaluated.
Default to seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=100).}

\item{ypoints}{Points on the first (x-) coordinate where the density is to be evaluated.
Default to seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=100).}

\item{levels}{numeric vector of levels at which to draw contour lines;
passed to the \link{contour} function in graphics.}

\item{nlevels}{number of contour levels desired \strong{if} levels is not supplied;
passed to the \link{contour} function in graphics.}

\item{cex, col, pch}{graphical parameters passed to \code{\link{points}} from graphics for plotting the data points.
Ignored if {show.data == FALSE}.}

\item{alpha}{color transparency for the data points, implemented via \code{\link[scales]{alpha}} from package \code{scales}.
Ignored if {show.data == FALSE}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the function \code{\link{contour}}.}
}
\description{
Contour plot for angmcmc objects with bivariate data
}
\details{
\code{contour.angmcmc} is an S3 function for angmcmc objects that calls \code{\link{contour}} from graphics.

To estimate the mixture density required to construct the contour plot, first the parameter vector \eqn{\eta} is estimated
by applying \code{fn} on the MCMC samples, yielding the (consistent) Bayes estimate \eqn{\hat{\eta}}. Then the mixture density
\eqn{f(x|\eta)} at any point \eqn{x} is (consistently) estimated by \eqn{f(x|\hat{\eta})}.

# first fit a vmsin mixture model
# illustration only - more iterations needed for convergence

# now create a contour plot
